  ABSTRACT = {Distraction while driving occurs when a driver is engaged in non-driving activities. These activities reduce the driver’s attention and focus on the road, therefore increasing the risk of accidents. As a consequence, the number of accidents increases and infrastructure is damaged. Cars are now equipped with different safety precautions that ensure driver awareness and attention at all times. The first step for such systems is to define whether the driver is distracted or not. Different methods are proposed to detect such distractions, but they lack efficiency when tested in real-life situations. In this paper, four machine learning classification methods are implemented and compared to identify drivers’ behavior and distraction situations based on real data corresponding to different behaviors such as aggressive, drowsy and normal. The data were randomized for a better application of the methods. We demonstrate that the gradient boosting method outperforms the other used classifiers.},
